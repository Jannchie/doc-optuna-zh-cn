"This callback enables tracking of Optuna study in Weights & Biases. The "
"study is tracked as a single experiment run, where all suggested "
"hyperparameters and optimized metrics are logged and plotted as a "
"function of optimizer steps."

"Users who want to run multiple Optuna studies within the same process "
"should call ``wandb.finish()`` between subsequent calls to "

"are running one Optuna study per process."

"Name assigned to optimized metric. In case of multi-objective "
