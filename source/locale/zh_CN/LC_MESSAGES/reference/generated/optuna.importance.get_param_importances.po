"The parameter importances are returned as a dictionary where the keys "
"consist of parameter names and their values importances. The importances "
"are represented by floating point numbers that sum to 1.0 over the entire"
" dictionary. The higher the value, the more important. The returned "
"dictionary is of type :class:`collections.OrderedDict` and is ordered by "
"its values in a descending order."

"If ``params`` is :obj:`None`, all parameter that are present in all of "

"parameters will be excluded from the evaluation. To assess the "
"importances of conditional parameters, a :obj:`list` of parameter names "
"can be specified via ``params``. If specified, only completed trials that"
" contain all of the parameters will be considered. If no such trials are "
"found, an error will be raised."
