"As SuccessiveHalving (SHA) requires the number of configurations "
":math:`n` as its hyperparameter.  For a given finite budget :math:`B`, "
"all the configurations have the resources of :math:`B \\over n` on "
"average. As you can see, there will be a trade-off of :math:`B` and "
":math:`B \\over n`. `Hyperband "
"<http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-558/16-558.pdf>`_ attacks this "
"trade-off by trying different :math:`n` values for a fixed budget."

"If you use ``HyperbandPruner`` with :class:`~optuna.samplers.TPESampler`,"

"As Hyperband runs multiple "

"Hyperband has several :class:`~optuna.pruners.SuccessiveHalvingPruner`. "
"Each :class:`~optuna.pruners.SuccessiveHalvingPruner` is referred as "
"\"bracket\" in the original paper. The number of brackets is an important"
" factor to control the early stopping behavior of Hyperband and is "
"automatically determined by ``min_resource``, ``max_resource`` and "
"``reduction_factor`` as `The number of brackets = "
"floor(log_{reduction_factor}(max_resource / min_resource)) + 1`. Please "
"set ``reduction_factor`` so that the number of brackets is not too large "
"(about 4 ~ 6 in most use cases). Please see Section 3.6 of the `original "
"paper <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-558/16-558.pdf>`_ for the "
